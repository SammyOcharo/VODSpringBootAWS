# üé• VODSIE HLS Video Processing Pipeline

## üìö Project Overview

In the modern world, delivering video content efficiently is critical for online platforms. The aim of this project was to **build an automated, serverless pipeline** that:
- **Converts uploaded videos into HLS format** (which supports adaptive streaming)
- **Stores the outputs in S3**
- **Serves the content globally via CloudFront for smooth, scalable playback**

The **goal** was to gain hands-on experience in designing an event-driven video processing architecture using **AWS services** like Lambda, MediaConvert, S3, and CloudFront.

---

## üéØ What We Learned

During this project, we deepened our knowledge in the following areas:
- How to configure **S3 event triggers** to automatically invoke a **Lambda function**.
- How to dynamically **create MediaConvert jobs** programmatically via Boto3 inside Lambda.
- How **CloudFront** dramatically improves video streaming performance by caching content closer to users.
- How to manage **IAM roles and permissions** for MediaConvert and Lambda.
- How to architect **serverless, scalable, and cost-efficient** video processing workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Upload a video** to the S3 bucket `vodsie/videos/`.
2. **Lambda function** is automatically triggered by the S3 event.
3. Lambda **creates a MediaConvert job** to:
   - Convert the uploaded video into HLS format.
   - Save output files under `vodsie/hls/converted/`.
4. **CloudFront CDN** serves the HLS output globally with low latency.

---

## üåç Why Use AWS CloudFront?

- **Global Caching**: Videos are cached at edge locations closer to users, reducing buffering.
- **High Availability**: Ensures users get a smooth streaming experience even under high traffic.
- **Security**: Integrates easily with signed URLs for secure video distribution.
- **Performance**: Improves video startup times and stream quality for viewers across the world.

---

## ‚ö° Role of the Lambda Function

- **Detects** when a new video is uploaded to S3 (`vodsie/videos/`).
- **Submits** a job to AWS MediaConvert to transform the video into HLS format.
- **Automates** the workflow ‚Äî no human intervention needed after upload.
- **Handles** MediaConvert endpoint discovery dynamically for high reliability.

---

## üöÄ What Can Be Done Next?

- **Multi-Resolution Streaming**: Output 1080p, 720p, 480p HLS renditions automatically.
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Generate video thumbnails with another MediaConvert or Lambda step.
- **Signed URLs**: Protect video content with CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.
- **Upload Interface**: Create a React/Next.js frontend for users to upload videos easily.
- **Notifications**: Add SNS notifications to alert when video conversion is complete.
- **Auto Cleanup**: Delete original large uploads from `vodsie/videos/` after processing.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Setup IAM Role
- Create a role `MediaConvertServiceRole` with permissions for:
  - MediaConvert full access
  - S3 read/write access
- Attach this role to the Lambda function.

### 2. Setup Lambda Function
- Runtime: **Python 3.10**
- Handler: `lambda_function.lambda_handler`
- Trigger: S3 event (Object Created) from bucket `vodsie/videos/`

### 3. Configure MediaConvert
- No special setup; the Lambda handles endpoint discovery automatically.

### 4. CloudFront Setup
- Create a CloudFront distribution with an origin pointing to your S3 bucket.
- Update bucket permissions to allow CloudFront access.
